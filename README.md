# What will we be doing?
This is a small tutorial/introduction on ReactJs.
We will start this Brown Bag with a small introduction with
slides by Tyson, then we'll jump right on into the tutorial.
Then I (Mark) will do the last part of the tutorial by adding a small
scroll feature to the web-app that we'll be making together, then I'll finish
off this Brown Bag with slides and questions.

**Note:** if you do not want to participate you're still welcome to come along and learn.
**But**, if you do want to follow along, you must bring/do:

- Laptop.
- [Download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) **NodeJs**.
- Go to your desktop directory and in your console type ```git clone https://github.com/MarkSchemmer/Mark-Tyson.git```.
    - If you do not have **Git**, [download here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

- In your console enter **demo-app** directory in the cloned git directory, in your console type ```npm install```
 (This should install all the dependencies that you will need).

As well this respository has all the slides and the finished tutorial as well.
