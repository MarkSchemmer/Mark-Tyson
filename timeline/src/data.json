At cum de plurimis eadem dicit, tum certe de maximis. Quod autem in homine praestantissimum atque optimum est, id deseruit. Equidem etiam Epicurum, in physicis quidem, Democriteum puto. Aliter enim nosmet ipsos nosse non possumus.Dempta enim aeternitate nihilo beatior Iuppiter quam Epicurus; Sic enim censent, oportunitatis esse beate vivere. Quem quidem vos, cum improbis poenam proponitis, inpetibilem facitis, cum sapientem semper boni plus habere vultis, tolerabilem. Atque hoc loco similitudines eas, quibus illi uti solent, dissimillimas proferebas. Ergo adhuc, quantum equidem intellego, causa non videtur fuisse mutandi nominis. Occultum facinus esse potuerit, gaudebit; Id mihi magnum videtur. Velut ego nunc moveor. Septem autem illi non suo, sed populorum suffragio omnium nominati sunt. Ergo illi intellegunt quid Epicurus dicat, ego non intellego? Sed quoniam et advesperascit et mihi ad villam revertendum est, nunc quidem hactenus; Ita relinquet duas, de quibus etiam atque etiam consideret.Confecta res esset. Aut haec tibi, Torquate, sunt vituperanda aut patrocinium voluptatis repudiandum. Aufert enim sensus actionemque tollit omnem. Nam memini etiam quae nolo, oblivisci non possum quae volo.",
